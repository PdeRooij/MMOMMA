## What is this repository for?
This repository contains the code for MMOMMA, and might even contain an executable in the future.

Music Man Online (MMO) is an online dance / rhythm game, with many different modes.
MMOMMA could in theory be used to obtain grade P on any mode, or song, or difficulty. :smile:
